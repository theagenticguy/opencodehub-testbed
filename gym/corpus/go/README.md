# go corpus

Golden goldens for the `gopls` differential SCIP indexer. Schema:
`corpusFileSchema` in `packages/gym/src/corpus.ts`. Cross-language index:
`../README.md` (if present) and fixture pins in `../repos/README.md`.

## Fixture

The single corpus here targets `spf13/cobra` v1.9.1 (commit
`40b5bc1437a564fc795d388b23835e84f54cd1d1`), vendored as a read-only submodule
under `packages/gym/corpus/repos/go/cobra`.

## Cases

All 13 cases in `cobra.yaml` were labeled by reading the cobra source directly
— no live scip-go runs were used to produce the expected sets, so the file is
a pure source-of-truth that a running gopls must agree with. Distribution: 2
`implementations`, 5 `references`, 6 `callers`. Cobra v1.9.1 is surprisingly
interface-poor for its size — `PositionalArgs` is a function type and
`SliceValue` is the only real `interface` — so the `implementations` slice is
smaller than the sibling Rust/TypeScript corpora; we compensate with denser
`callers` coverage (`Command.execute`, `Command.Execute`, `Command.ExecuteC`,
`Command.AddCommand`, `Command.PersistentFlags`, `Command.FlagErrorFunc`)
that exercises single-site targets, self-recursion, and high-fanout
accessors.

## Known gaps

One `implementations` case (`SliceValue`) is waived because the only
implementors live in `github.com/spf13/pflag` outside the fixture; once
pflag is pinned into the corpus or we decide how to encode
external-dependency impls, the waiver can be lifted.
